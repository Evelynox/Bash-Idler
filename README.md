## üéÆ Game Mechanics
- **Generators**: Purchase Linux-themed generators (`systemd`, `bash`, `cron`, etc.) that produce income
- **Upgrades**: Improve each generator's income multiplier and production speed separately  
- **Scaling economy**: Costs increase exponentially, creating strategic depth
- **Passive income**: Generators work automatically while the game runs
- **Command customization**: Rename any command using the `mv` system
